In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a popular approach for financial portfolio trading problems. 

Portfolio allocation poses a significant decision-making problem for traders who must continuously adjust their investments based on complex technical analyses of historical data and stock market behavior.
This thesis introduces a fresh perspective by applying a model-free RL method on a wider range of portfolio assets and delving into the Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a discretized action space in order to tackle convergence instability challenges. It further provides insight into the models' decision-making mechanisms, training stability, and result variance, offering a comprehensive view of portfolio allocation. The approach is benchmarked on several portfolios and compared with existing state-of-the art models.
